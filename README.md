## DogBreedApp
Web app for identifying dog breeds

### Libraries
`flask` was used to build the web app. `keras` was used to define model architectures and train the model. `openCV` and `scikit-learn` were used to train a logistic regression model on the results of Haar cascade classifiers to predict if human faces were present or not.
